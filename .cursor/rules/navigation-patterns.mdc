# Navigation Patterns

## Link Structure
Navigation links should follow these patterns:
1. Primary navigation links should be in `.desktop-nav`
2. Each link should have a unique, descriptive text or aria-label
3. Blog link should use "üìù Read my technical articles" as text
4. Projects link should use "Browse my open source projects" as text
5. Contact link should use "Get in touch" as text

## Navigation Testing
When testing navigation in [tests/routes.spec.ts](mdc:tests/routes.spec.ts):
1. Use `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'` for faster page loads
2. Verify navigation links are visible before clicking
3. Check for page-specific elements after navigation
4. Handle loading states for dynamic content

## Error Handling
1. 404 pages should show `.error` class
2. Include a link back to home page
3. Display appropriate error message
4. Maintain consistent navigation structure
