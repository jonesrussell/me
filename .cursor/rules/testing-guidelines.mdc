# Testing Guidelines

## Playwright Test Selectors
When writing Playwright tests in [tests/routes.spec.ts](mdc:tests/routes.spec.ts), follow these selector guidelines:

1. Use `getByRole()` for interactive elements like links and buttons
2. Use specific text content with `getByText()` when targeting text elements
3. Avoid generic selectors like `a[href="/path"]` that could match multiple elements
4. For navigation tests, use the exact link text or aria label to ensure unique matches

## Test Structure
Tests should follow this pattern:
1. Arrange: Set up test conditions and locate elements
2. Act: Perform actions (clicks, navigation)
3. Assert: Verify expected outcomes
4. Use appropriate timeouts for async operations

## Navigation Testing
When testing navigation in [tests/routes.spec.ts](mdc:tests/routes.spec.ts):
1. Wait for elements to be visible before interacting
2. Use `waitForURL()` to confirm navigation
3. Verify page-specific elements are present
4. Handle loading states appropriately
