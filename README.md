# My create-svelte website

Everything I needed to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Created project

If you're seeing this, I already did this step. Hooray!

```bash
# created a new project in myapp
npm create svelte@latest myapp
```

## Developing

Once I created a project I installed dependencies with `npm install`, then started a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

I create production versions of my app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Sometimes I preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy my app, I installed a Github pages [adapter](https://www.sveltesociety.dev/packages?category=sveltekit-adapters#svelte-adapter-github) for your target environment.
